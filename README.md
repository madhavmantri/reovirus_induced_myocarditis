Description: Here, we used integrated single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomics to study the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of innate and adaptive immune responses and cell-cell interactions in reovirus-infected murine hearts. This repository contains spatial RNAseq imagin data, code scripts, and all the meta data required to analyse time course scRNA-seq and spatial RNAseq data of reovirus infected murine hearts. The raw sequencing data and processed count matrices needed for this analysis have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSEXXXXXXX.
